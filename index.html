    <h1> Slavery Comes to North America, 1619 </h1><br><br><br><br>
    <img src="slaves.png"><br><br><br><br><br>
    <h1 id="year1619"> 1619</h1>
    <p id="p_year1619">In 1619, a Dutch ship arrived in Jamestown, Virginia, bringing with it a group of African people who were forced into slavery. This event marked the beginning of a bad time in North American history. These Africans were not treated as equal but were made to work without pay and were not free to leave. This was the start of a system where people were treated unfairly based on the color of their skin.</p>
    <h1 id="year1641">1641</h1>
    <p id="p_year1641">In 1641, Massachusetts passed laws permitting people to own others as slaves, changing life in the American colonies. Slavery became common, where some people were treated as property and forced to work without pay. This created an unequal system where people had power over others based on their skin color. Slavery spread to other colonies causing a lot inequality and unfairness throughout American history. The laws made slavery legal and normalized its practice, leading to an effect.</p>
    <h1 id="year1661">1661</h1>
    <p id="p_year1661">In 1661, Virginia passed laws making children of enslaved mothers also slaves, and couples with one enslaved partner had to split up. These rules deepened slavery's life and caused families to break apart. It was a tough time, especially for African people, who suffered the most under these unfair laws. The laws made slavery more permanent and separated families, which was really hard for everyone involved.</p>
    <h1 id="year1739">1739</h1>    
    <p>The Stono Rebellion of 1739 was slaves uprising in colonial South Carolina. It began on September 9, 1739, when a group of about 20 enslaved Africans got weapons, took weapons from a store, and marched toward Spanish Florida, where they thought they could find freedom. Along the way, they raised a sign that read "Liberty!" They also killed several white colonists and burned down houses.</p>   
    <h1 id="year1787">1787</h1>
    <p>In 1787, crucial decisions were made about slavery in America. Leaders came together to create rules for how the country would work. They debated important issues like how to count enslaved people and whether slavery should be allowed in new areas. finally, they made a impotortant decision to stop slavery in the Northwest Territory.</p>
    <h1 id="year1807">1807</h1>  
    <p>In 1807, the US Congress made a big decision. They passed a law that said no one could bring enslaved people from Africa into the country anymore. This was a really important decision because it showed that people were starting to understand that everyone deserves to be treated fairly, no matter where they come from or what they look like. It was the right decision.</p>
    <h1 id="year1865">ðŸŽ‰1865ðŸŽ‰</h1>
    <p>In 1865, a huge moment happened in America about slavery. They passed a law called the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This law said that slavery was not allowed anywhere in the country. It was a really big deal because it meant that people couldn't own other people anymore. This was an important step towards making sure everyone had freedom and rights.</P>
