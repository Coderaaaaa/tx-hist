    <h1> 1619</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 40px; text-align: center;">
        In 1619, a Dutch ship arrived in Jamestown, Virginia, bringing with it a group of African people who were forced into slavery. This event marked the beginning of a troubling time in North American history.
         These Africans were not treated as equals but were made to work without pay and were not free to leave. This was the start of a system where people were treated unfairly based on the color of their skin.
          It was a sad and difficult time for those who were enslaved and for the country as a whole.<br>
